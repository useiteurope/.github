# We are USE-IT!
USE-IT is a collaborative European network of local initiatives dedicated to publishing free city maps for young travellers. The information provided is no-nonsense, created by locals, non-commercial, and up-to-date.

Each map highlights around a hundred locations in the city, including museums, bars, affordable restaurants, clubs, and places where visitors can mingle with locals rather than other tourists. The project is entirely non-commercial, with no fees for inclusion. The maps are distributed for free in hostels, tourist information centres, youth information centres, welcome packages for exchange students, and other such venues.

The initiative to start a new USE-IT map always comes from young locals, who independently seek funding and are responsible for their own content and graphic design. Each chapter prints and distributes between 20,000 and 180,000 maps annually. Most also manage social media pages, some have websites, and a few operate their own information desks. Our network is driven by young people and professionals from varied backgrounds, including product development, graphic design, software development, fundraising, and community facilitation â€“ all passionate about digital products, cartography, and sharing unique tips about their cities.

Every local USE-IT initiative is a member of the international not-for-profit organisation USE-IT Europe. The aim of USE-IT Europe is to support new members in the network and to uphold the name as a quality label: local initiatives can only become members if they strictly adhere to the non-commercial principles.

The name USE-IT originated in 1971 in Copenhagen, but the actual network of city maps began in 2005 with the first map of Ghent (Belgium). Since then, the number of cities in the network has grown each year, with the 100th city which printed a map in 2023.
