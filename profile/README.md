# We are USE-IT! üåç

USE-IT is a collaborative European network of local initiatives dedicated to publishing free city maps for young travellers. The information provided is straightforward, created by locals, non-commercial, and up-to-date.

## What We Do üó∫Ô∏è

Each map highlights around a hundred locations in the city, including museums, bars, affordable restaurants, clubs, and places to connect with locals rather than other tourists. The project is entirely non-commercial, with no fees for inclusion. Maps are distributed for free in hostels, tourist information centres, youth information centres, welcome packages for exchange students, and other venues.

## How It Works ü§ù

The initiative to start a new USE-IT map always comes from young locals who seek funding and are responsible for their own content and design. Each chapter prints and distributes between 20,000 and 180,000 maps annually. Many also manage social media pages, websites, and information desks.

Our network is driven by young people and professionals from various backgrounds, including product development, graphic design, software development, fundraising, and community facilitation. All share a passion for digital products, cartography, and unique city insights.

## Our Network üåê

Every local USE-IT initiative is part of the international not-for-profit organisation USE-IT Europe. The aim of USE-IT Europe is to support new members and maintain the name as a quality label. Local initiatives can only become members if they adhere to our non-commercial principles.

## Our History üìú

The name USE-IT originated in 1971 in Copenhagen, but the network of city maps began in 2005 with the first map of Ghent, Belgium. Since then, the number of cities in the network has grown, reaching our 100th city in 2023
